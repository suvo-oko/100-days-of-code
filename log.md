# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: April 8 30, 2021

### Today's Progress

- I'm using the book [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) to build the foundations.
- The author has [a page with resources](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/) to accompany the book.
- Today I studied chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the book.
- The topics covered were:
  - Variables
  - Strings
  - Numbers (integers, and floats)
  - Lists

### Thoughts

- I had studied some Python before, and even took a course on Linux Academy, but now I want to take it seriously and trace my progress.
- That's why I want to start with the basics and build from there.
- For the first month or so of this journey, I'll be following the **Python Crash Course** book.
- I'll write code every day, but for the beginning it will be more like notes to my future self and to others.
- This is [my Python Journey repo](https://github.com/suvo-oko/python-journey)
